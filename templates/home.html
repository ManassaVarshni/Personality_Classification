  <p>Have you ever wondered what type of personality you have? Or how much of an extroverted person you are?</p><br>
  <p>I have done exactly this in this project. Using the Big Five Personality dataset, and with the help of Machine Learning algorithms, I have developed a project which will tell you your personality scores across five broad types - extroversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.</p><br> 
  <p>All you have to do is click on the Test button and answer some of the questions asked. Sit back and wait for your results to appear!</p><br>
  <p>Skills demonstrated - Machine Learning, Python, Deployment</p>
